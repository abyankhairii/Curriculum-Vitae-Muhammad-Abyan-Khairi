            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Let me introduce myself, my full name is Muhammad Abyan Khairi, 17 years old, I come from the city of Medan, North Sumatra.
                My vision and mission is to be the best in the future in the field that I am interested in and achieve
                in order to make both parents happy with the initial stage for now, namely becoming
                Students are energetic and full of enthusiasm in studying at <a href="https://it.usu.ac.id/" target="_blank">Information Technology, University of North Sumatra.</a>
                I will try to hone my skills in the fields of computers, programming and networking.</p>
                <p>Since childhood, I have been interested in technology, especially in the field of robotics. I always
                    wanted to know how all the robot toys my mother bought me could move, make sounds and glow.
                    So I often break and can't repair the robot toys anymore. I had time
                    leaving my curiosity with robotics behind
                    because when I was little there were no tutoring places or courses nearby for robotics that I could learn.
                    Even YouTube at that time was not as busy as it is now, which can display a variety of tutorial content for making many things like today.
                    So I had time to shift my interest from robotics to development. Starting from me who likes playing Lego, playing the game Minecraft
                    and had aspired to become a building consultant and architect. I also like playing Rubik's cubes and enjoy playing
                    math. However, the fact that I have partial color blindness makes me insecure
                    to dream of joining a civil engineering or architecture study program. I was down, but I succeeded
                    rose thanks to the encouragement of my parents who said that there is not just one path to success. When I
                    Sitting in high school at MAN 2 Model Medan, it turned out there was a robotics extracurricular which made me interested in the field
                    robotics is back. However, unfortunately there were no teachers or mentors to teach the extracurricular so we studied
                    self-taught via YouTube. Because it coincided with Covid at that time, this extracurricular activity was not supported by
                    the principal and we did not take part in any competitions. However, I didn't give up because I believed in my lectures
                    Currently I am able to take part in existing competitions. I didn't expect that I could only succeed through
                    only in the robotics field, however, I hope to be the best in whatever field I end up in.
